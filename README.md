# online-test-webapp
Hello, I made this sample app. I created this app using programming languages such that python, flask and pywebio. <br>

Pywebio is a module in python that allow developers to create web application without using HTML and CSS, we can also use pywebio with flask,Djnago and other web frameworks.

# Here are the Steps for running this project.
1. git clone<br>
2. pip install requirements.txt<br>
3. python app.py<br>

Project Overview:<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based quiz application using Python and Flask, deployed on the Azure platform. The application aims to provide an interactive and engaging quiz-taking experience for users on various topics.<br>
Project Description:<br>
A Python package called PyWebIO makes it easier to create interactive web apps straight from Python scripts. Without the requirement for understanding of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, it offers a set of functions for creating a variety of user interface elements, including buttons, input forms, charts, and more. Because PyWebIO is meant to be simple to use, developers who work with Python primarily can use it to construct web-based apps.<br>
Features:<br>
1.	Quiz Module:<br>
•	Allows users to participate in a quiz.<br>

Description About Azure container Registry Service:<br>
Microsoft Azure offers a fully managed container registry service called Azure Container Registry (ACR). It facilitates the creation, distribution, and deployment of containerized apps by acting as a central repository for managing and storing Docker container images. With its easy integration with other Azure services and support for both Windows and Linux container images, ACR offers a complete solution for containerized workflows. <br>
An important part of Azure's container ecosystem, Azure Container Registry offers a safe and effective way to manage container images in the cloud. It is essential to contemporary application development and deployment procedures since it makes containerized architectures more widely used.<br>
Description about Azure container Instance service:<br>
Microsoft Azure offers a serverless container service called Azure Container Instances (ACI). It makes it simple to quickly deploy and scale containerized apps by allowing you to run containers without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. When you require a flexible and lightweight container runtime environment without the hassle of administering a container orchestrator, Azure Container Instances is a good option.<br>
